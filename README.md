# DND Submit

Train your own model for denoising and submit the denoised results to [DND](https://noise.visinf.tu-darmstadt.de/).

> Typical result: sRGB track, PSNR > 39, SSIM > 0.95

## Data

Download the [dataset (22 GB)](https://pan.baidu.com/s/13_P1OnSqjVYO2bsei_ZbvQ) (xmfw) and extract the files to `./data/` folder.

## Model

This repo provides the codes of DnCNN, U-Net and ResNet, but you can use your own model by adding it to `./model/` folder.

## Train

Train your model:

```
python train.py --model YourModelName
```

Optional arguments:

```
  --model MODEL          model name
  --ps PS                patch size
  --lr LR                learning rate
  --epochs EPOCHS        sum of epochs
  --freq FREQ            learning rate update frequency
  --save_freq SAVE_FREQ  save result frequency
  --syn                  use synthetic noisy images
```

**In order to reduce the time to read the images, it will save all the images in memory which requires large memory.**

## Submit

Test the trained model on DND and get the denoised results:

```
python submit.py --model YourModelName
```

The results are in `./result/test/bundled/`.
